Description of Design

adding shapes
- click on the button that represents the shape
- press mouse anywhere on graphics pane (don't release) -- this will be x and y
- drag mouse to where you want the bottom right of shape to be
- Current action will be remembered
NOTE: for hexagon, treat methodology as if you are drawing a rectangle
/ \	<-- Hexagon draws like so

removing shapes
- Click on delete button
- Click on shape to delete
NOTE: currentShape will be set to null and currentShapeIndex to -1

selecting shapes/lines
- Click / Mouse-press on a shape/line 
(Provided that line, rectangle, oval or hexagon buttons were not clicked before)
NOTE: currentShape selected will be remebered
NOTE: Lines used as 'connectors' to shapes can only be selected to be deleted

resizing
- select a shape or a stand-alone line
- if mouse is moved to right, shape should be made that much wider on each side
- if the mouse is moved to left, the shape should be made that much narrower on each side
- if the mouse is moved up, the shape should be made that much higher top and bottom
- if the mouse is moved down, the shape should be made that much shorter top and bottom.
NOTE: The effect is that if the user drags from the top right corner of
    the shape, the shape should be resized to whereever the dragged to.
NOTE: currentShape selected will be remebered

moving
- select a shape or a stand-alone line
- drag and release the mouse to where you want to move the shape
NOTE: currentShape selected will be remebered

setting text
- select a shape
- type text in the 'shape text' textbox
NOTE: It is not possible to set text on a line

adding lines
- Click on line button
	- if you select a shape by mouse-press then drag and release it to another shape
	line will serve as a 'connector' -- connect the two shapes
	- if you mouse-press then drag and release on an empty space, 
	it will draw a stand-alone line.
	- if you mouse-press on a shape then drag and release on an empty space,
	line won't draw (and vice-versa)
NOTE: stand-alone lines can be moved and resized
NOTE: lines used as connectors will automatically adjust to where their
connected shapes are. Connectors have triple the width of stand-alone lines

removing lines
- Click on delete button
- Click on line to delete
NOTE: currentShape will be set to null and currentShapeIndex to -1
NOTE: lines used as connectors are independent to the two shapes they connect to.

E.g. shape1 is connected by line1 to shape2. If I delete shape 1 and 2,
line1 won't deleted and will still be there. There would be no way to move
or resize line1. The only thing you can do is to delete it.

Justification of Design (Completion)
- Design is consistent (Click on button then Act)
- Errors are prevented where possible instead of try-catch
- Design is easy to follow (minimalist design)

Problems with Design (Completion)
- May be difficult for some people to resize with ultimate precision
No values to adjust or sliders to explore from (resize is just by trial and 
error)
- Text inside a shape will go off to the sides (overflow) if shape width is far
more less than the 'text width'
- No indication of what the currentShape is
	- The most recent selected shape, if any, is not 'highlighted'.
	User will have to remember what and where he last preseed the mouse
